# Starting the game and troubleshooting

- When you start the game, the 1st map will be loaded and the game will start in paused state. To start you have to press `Esc`.

- If the game has started, but you cannot move, press `Space` to jump and everything should be back to normal.

- See the `CONTROLS.md` file for more information on game controls.
